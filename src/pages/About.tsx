        <p>I built this simply for fun. I wanted to learn more about stacks and queues. So here we are!</p>
        <h2>Why React?</h2>
        <p>When I started this project I did not feel like learning another JS framework. I am familiar with React, Create React App, Express.js and Next.js. Now I am much more open to learning another JS framework or even another method for web developement in a different language.</p>
